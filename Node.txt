Node.js
==============
Node is the java script runtime environment outside the browser.
Node is use for creating backend services.

It is mostly use for Highly scalable, data intensive and real time application.
It is very easy to use prototyping and in agile development.
Paypal, uber, netflix etc

Using Node a complete web application can be written in java script. making complete code cleaner.

Browser has java script engine which converts Java script code into machine code.

Node exe has inbuilt java script engine made over chrome v8 engine to run java script code. it also has additional java script 
API's which provides additional capabilities which browser doesn't have.

It is not a framework but it is just a rumtime environment for executing the java script code.

It is based on Non-Asynchronous nature. It has single thread which handle multiple request.

It maintain event queue in the backend and responds to the event once they are ready like Data ready event.

Should not use for the CPU intensive application.

Node Module System -
Every file in the node module system is considered as module. like app.js file is 1 module.
All the variables and functions can only be access in tht module so they are like private. 
to access them in different module then we need to make them public.
